                <h2>Inferences</h2>
                <p>From type 1 graph we can infer,
                    The pattern of how are the buses following the schedule. Generally, after the one-third of the journey, the buses are 
                    getting off time. In the majority of the cases, they are not able to cover up for the delay and instead the distance from 
                    the planned position further increases on the route ahead. But it is also observed that on the longer trips, the difference 
                    in the distance reduces towards the end.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Graph 2 & 4  gives us the average distance and time of the bus from the planned stop throughout the journey. Using this graph, 
                    we can find out the trips which are most off time and work on finding the root cause of the problem on the narrowed 
                    down number of trips. It gives valuable data for designing a solution. By mapping down the particular route, we can 
                    brainstorm the possible issues and the stakeholders and lead towards an effective solution.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     From graph 3 we can observe the visible trend that the time difference at the stop in actual and planned data for a particular route 
                     is more or less constant except a very few cases. From this it is easy to infer that the major cause of delay of buses is that they are
                     leaving late from the depot.
